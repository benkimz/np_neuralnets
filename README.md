# Building Neural Networks in Python's Numpy
## *I'm a TensorFlow & Keras fanatic and passionate about machine learning.
## <p>
    This repo presents some cool algorithms built in Python's Numpy library. It's where it all begun! I like to recall the first steps I took. It's cool developing the algorithms in Numpy but often you write a lot of code.

## <p> Installing numpy.</p>

```console
    $pip install numpy
```
## Considering a Deep Learning Framework? These could help you build real fast and in a few lines of code. Just choose whichever best suits your needs and makes you comfortable.
